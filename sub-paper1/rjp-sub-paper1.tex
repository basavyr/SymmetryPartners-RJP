\section{Introduction compatibility}
The Romanian Journal of Physics (RJP) style was designed to allow authors, who use mainly \LaTeX ~for typesetting their papers, to  submit contributions to this journal of the Romanian Academy Publishing House. At the same time, by using this style, the authors will have much better control over the final layout of their paper and they will know the number of pages their contribution will occupy when bound in the printed volume (of course only if their contribution will first be accepted and recommended by RJP's referees for publication). \cite{knuth} and \cite{dknuthhp} are citations.

\section{Examples for various Environments}
This section includes examples of different environments containing media and data material (the copyright of which is already owned by RJP) much needed in any good scientific publication. For instance below (in figure \ref{pic1}) we present a \textit{figure} environment as it must appear in every contribution submitted to our journal (this picture is in PNG format so compiling must be done using \textit{pdflatex} command rather than the usual \textit{latex} command or one should specify the \textbf{pdftex} driver when loading the \textbf{graphicx} package).

\textit{number of bound states dependence on the radius of space curvature for $\alpha = 0.005$, $U_0 = 1$}''.}
